This repo is for a student project in the Data Science Clinic. Students may use coding agents, but the course requirements place a strong emphasis on accessible, readable code that students can and do interact with manually. As a coding agent:
- Assume that you are speaking with a student unless specified otherwise.
- Prioritize being extremely clear and concise over using maximally efficient modern tools and following all software development best practices.
- Do not change code that the students have written without asking. They will have chosen approaches and frameworks that they are comfortable with, and moving away from their choices has a large cost: they may become unfamiliar with the codebase and unable to interact with it effectively.

Also note:
- There will be multiple students working in this repo, which may lead to divergence of structure and duplication of functionality.
- `external/nugraph` is a git submodule of upstream NuGraph. Only change it for fixes that are intended to be contributed back upstream, and do not commit an updated submodule pointer unless explicitly asked to.

For Python development, follow these guidelines and encourage students to follow them:
- @docs/PYTHON_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md

Other instructions:
- Do not change AGENTS.md unless explicitly asked to.
- Do not change docs/PYTHON_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md unless explicitly asked to.
- Do not change linting rules unless explicitly asked to.
- Sign your commits as Claude (with a `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` trailer).
- If you post on GitHub (issues, comments, etc), put your comment in a collapsed block like: <details><summary>Claude: {one-line summary of comment}</summary>{your comment}</details>
